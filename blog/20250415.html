            Hi there! If you're reading this, that means <strong>chromonospace</strong> is live. Woohoo!
            <hr>
            <p>
            How did I come up with the name '<strong>chromonospace</strong>'? I've always loved monospace fonts because they're straightforward, practical, and uniform, and wanted to incorporate it here as a design element. The 'chromo-' prefix is an alliterative choice and inspires the prismatic-type color scheme.
            <p>
            My <strong>space</strong> here has been passively in the works for a few months now. All I have to show for it so far is a landing page, an about page, and this one "blog" post, but I'm still really proud of it nevertheless. 
            <p>
            The bulk of those few months were spent learning basic HTML/CSS skills. I had some limited exposure to these languages growing up as a chronically online teenager, but I never really committed myself to learning them until recently. I've always been a creative person and love exploring different outlets for that creativity, so it's been a treat to learn some web design skills. If you're a web developer, don't inspect my page if you value your sanity - I'm very sure my code is a hot ass mess.
            <p>
            Please note that this website is best viewed on desktop. I'd very much like to claim that's by design (to harken back to the good ol' days of the internet) but truthfully it's because I have no idea how to optimize for mobile yet. It's not high on my priority list right now, so I don't know if or when that will happen. 
            <p>
            Thanks for visiting! I hope you'll stop by again soon.
