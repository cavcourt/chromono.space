            <p>My mother often reminds me that I'm too hard on myself. I'm tired of hearing it because I know she's right.
            <hr>
            <p>I find comfort in the idea of taking responsibility for all aspects of my life. It gives me agency and pride when I guide my life in the direction of success and fulfillment of my goals. Yet, I feel like my own greatest obstacle because I fail to live up to my own standards most of the time.
            <p>The last six or so months have been the most challenging time of my entire life. I experienced multiple major overlapping life changes - a job change, a major move, a ton of traveling, a breakup, and the most devastating of all, being blocked/ghosted by somebody whom I dearly love.
            <p>All of that has shaken my self confidence in a way I've never quite experienced before. I'm usually able to keep myself controlled and pick up the pieces, but it was just too much at once. Leaving my bed often feels impossible, and the only semblence of relief I can grab hold of is eating my feelings. I gained 15 pounds in the past two or so months and I've never felt more uncomfortable and incapable in my body. I feel enormous internal pressure to overhaul my diet and hit the gym to reverse this immediately. But I also know from experience that trying to do too much all at once is the quickest ticket to making everything worse.
            <p>I'm still barely scratching the surface of learning my new job, exploring my new neighborhood, unpacking my things, and navigating the emotional turmoil of perceived abandonment. So I'm just trying to... accept myself for what I am right now, and gently guide myself toward building habits. Much easier said than done.
            <p>When it comes to dealing with my interpersonal challenges, I try to remember that we are all just doing our best and most times, aren't intentionally out to hurt others. They just end up as collateral damage as we fight our own internal battles. This is a whole other essay, but I really feel western society is increasingly rewarding "toxic individualism" and narcissistic coping mechanisms for interpersonal difficulties. I'm not saying that full-tilt collectivism is the answer, but I do think there needs to be a better balance. I think we need to consider eachother more and stop confusing interdependence and codependency. It's okay to rely on others sometimes.
            <hr>
            <p>In conclusion... Despite having the wind firmly knocked out of me, I still believe my greatest strength lies in my courage to be vulnerable. More people than I or you realize are going through similar struggles, but we keep it hidden inside because we are afraid of showing weakness in what can feel like a wading pool of sharks. Seeing that you're not alone can be healing in such a transformative way.
            <p>So, I'll continue to choose to continue channeling love and empathy into others. By extension, it reminds me of our shared humanity and helps me channel more love and empathy into myself.</p>
