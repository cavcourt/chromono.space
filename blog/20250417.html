                <p>My mother often reminds me that I'm too hard on myself. I'm tired of hearing it because I know she's right.
                <hr>
                <p>I find comfort in the idea of taking responsibility for all aspects of my life. It gives me agency and pride when I guide my life in the direction of success and fulfillment of my goals. Yet I feel like my own greatest obstacle because I often fail to live up to my own standards.
                <p>The last six or so months have been the most challenging of my entire life. I experienced multiple major overlapping life changes: new job, major interstate move, a breakup, and — most devastating of all — being ghosted by a dearly beloved friend.
                <p>All of that has shaken my stability in a way I've never quite experienced before. I'm usually able to keep myself controlled and pick up the pieces, but this broke me. While I feel things are headed in a positive direction some days, other days leaving my bed feels impossible and the only semblence of relief I can grab hold of is eating my feelings. I feel enormous internal pressure to overhaul my diet and get my gym habit going again, but I also know from experience that trying to do too much at once is the quickest ticket to making everything worse. I'm still barely scratching the surface of learning my new job, exploring my new neighborhood, unpacking my things, navigating the emotional turmoil of perceived abandonment... That's more than enough to deal with right now. 
                <p>So I'm just trying to... accept myself at my present state and gently rebuild some healthier habits, outlets and routines. Much easier said than done, but I'm getting there. I think.
                <p>Despite everything, I fundamentally believe my greatest strength lies in my ability to be vulnerable regardless of how deeply I hurt. I'm trying to hone this ability even further by finally publishing my website, even though exposing myself like this scares me a bit. I think many people are going through similar struggles, but keep it all locked inside because we are afraid of showing weakness in what can feel like a wading pool of sharks. So I hope I can reach people who feel alone like I often do. Community can be healing in such a transformative way.
